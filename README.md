This is a repository containing the jupyter notebook on the analysis of the data and models built for the undergraduate thesis i carried out. It is titled A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE SOLUTION GAS-OIL RATIO OF NIGERIAN CRUDE OIL

AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
1.AIM
This research project aims to estimate the solution gas-oil ratio of Nigerian crude oil via a machine
learning approach.
2. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this research work include:
1. Obtain historical PVT data of a Niger Delta field
2. Use several machine learning algorithms to estimate the solution gas-oil ratio
3. Analyze the accuracy of the machine learning models
4. Determine the machine learning model with the best prediction accuracy
5. Perform a sensitivity analysis on the available data to determine which input parameter
accounts for the high accuracy of the output parameter

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
The world is becoming more technology inclined, and any individual, company or organization that cannot adapt to this change will be left behind. The oil and gas industry is one of the industries adapting to this change by using technology to solve its problems to save time and cost.
Estimating solution gas-oil ratio via PVT analysis is costly, timeconsuming, and the analysis is prone to human error. Although correlations were developed to
combat this challenge, some were usually developed for specific regions hence the inability to apply these correlations in other regions.
The significance of this research project is to proffer an alternative approach that is less costly, less tedious and not time consuming to predict solution gas-oil ratio by using several machine learning algorithms. 
More specifically, this research will be answering the following questions:
1. Can the machine learning approach designed in this research help estimate the solution
gas-oil ratio?
2. Which machine learning model predicted with the best accuracy?
